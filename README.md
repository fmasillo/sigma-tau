# Constant Time and Space Updates for the Sigma-Tau Problem

This repository contains three C code files for constructing the Hamiltonian path(s) and the Hamiltonian cycle in the Sigma-Tau graph.

File hp.c contains the code for generating the Hamiltonian path with the rule present in [1]. \
File hp_prime.c contains the code for generating the Hamiltonian path with the rule present in [2]. \
File hc.c contains the code for generating the Hamiltonian cycle with the rule present in [2].
